# hello-world
This repository is for practicing the GitHub and CodeKY assignments.
My name is Jessica & I am trying to change careers by learning to code. I want to learn to code so I can have more options and some flexibility with my work. My husband and I love traveling so remote work would be great! I also want to have more time to spend with our kids once we start a family.
